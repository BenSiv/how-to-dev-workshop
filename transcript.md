## Background
This workshop was created to give project students in celleste-bio the necessary background to get started with the project. It has been opened for all trendlines startup hub as a knowledge share gesture.

## Intro
I called the workshop 'How To Dev' because it is mainly targeted for the software development audience, yet I do think that the ideas behind it is greater and can contribute to wider audience. 

This workshop revolves around one common theme and three major enablers to rich the ultimate goal.
The theme is: "Software is messy, especially when distributed"
No one wants to get a bug and hear "but it works on my machine" and the greatest compliment on software is "just works".

The three enablers are:
- Linux
- Git
- Docker
